# 🍎 Mana Finance - Vibe Coding
Continuing my studies and keeping the Vibe Coding alive, here’s my second project in the field. I pushed myself a bit further this time, using Cursor alongside Lovable and deploying everything on Vercel. The result is a personal-finance manager. It isn’t as detailed or comprehensive as some other projects out there, but the main goal was to explore new tools and sharpen my skills. You’ll find the live-deployment link below—feel free to check it out!

## 📑 Learning
This project was a lot of fun to build, and I’m learning so much about these new tools and how to use them effectively. It might receive updates in the future, but even with a few small bugs, I’m satisfied with its current version (for now). I’ll keep building projects with the Vibe Coding approach, pushing my creativity to create even more exciting things. Vibe Coding is definitely here to challenge old paradigms in IT and software development—we’re at the beginning of a new era, and these tools have enormous growth potential. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the project, and I’ll be back soon with more updates!

The entire project was documented automatically using AI. Initially, I created the documentation manually in a Notion document, including feature prompts and hotfixes for bug fixes. Later, when I integrated Cursor as a development tool, it automatically generated a technical documentation for the project, which can be found in the @docs folder in the repository.
